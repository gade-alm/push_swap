# push_swap

The objective of this project is to make a sorthing algorithm using only two stacks to move the numbers and a few movements
we are allowed to do. I chose to implement radix sort to sort when I had 6 or more numbers, if I had 4 or 5 just send two numbers to stack B then sort the stack A, then push it back again to stack A, and with 3 numbers just checked all possible ways it could be mixed up and made the code checking each one of them.
